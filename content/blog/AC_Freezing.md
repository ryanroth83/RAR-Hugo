Found this on a new build house. A/C would run and then stop cooling. As you can see I found the valve at the condensor line freezing over. This can be cause by inoperable fan, restricted air flow, restriction in refridgerant line or low refridgerent. How like to move into your new house only to find the A/C to work for an hour and then freeze over & stop cooling? Also when it is turned off & the ice melts you now have water, not a big deal on the outside unit, but this can also happen on the evaporator side that is usually in the attic and may leak out through the ceiling.
